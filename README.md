# AVL self-balancing tree
AVL self-balancing binary search tree with basic unrolled linked list memory management.

Each node has a key, which is ordered, and a value associated with that key. The value can be of any data type, including a predefined struct. You simply need to define the size of the type upon initialisation, cast the type as a ```(void*)``` pointer type when inputting, and cast the output value as your data type.
